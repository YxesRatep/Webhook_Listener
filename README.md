# Webhook Listener

A simple webhook listener that receives and processes HTTP requests sent by external services. Useful for handling real-time updates such as payment notifications, GitHub events, or form submissions.

## ðŸš€ What is a Webhook Listener?

A **webhook** is a way for one application to send real-time data to another whenever a certain event happens. This listener receives that data and can act on it â€” log it, store it, trigger internal workflows, etc.

This project sets up a basic HTTP endpoint to **listen** for those webhook events.
